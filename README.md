<h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>

JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.

Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. The name was suggested and provided in the times when Java was gaining popularity in the market. In addition to web browsers, databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language.

<b>Features of JavaScript</b>

There are following features of JavaScript:

1. All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.
2. JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.
3. JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the operation).
4. JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.
5. It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.
6. It is a case-sensitive language.
7. JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.
8. It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.

<b>Application of JavaScript</b>

JavaScript is used to create interactive websites. It is mainly used for:

1. Client-side validation,
2. Dynamic drop-down menus,
3. Displaying date and time,
4. Displaying pop-up windows and dialog boxes (like an alert dialog box, confirm dialog box and prompt dialog box),
5. Displaying clocks etc.


# TypeScript

<b>What is TypeScript?</b>

TypeScript is an open-source pure object-oriented programing language. It is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript which compiles to plain JavaScript. It contains all elements of the JavaScript. It is a language designed for large-scale JavaScript application development, which can be executed on any browser, any Host, and any Operating System. The TypeScript is a language as well as a set of tools. TypeScript is the ES6 version of JavaScript with some additional features.

<b>TypeScript Introduction</b>

TypeScript cannot run directly on the browser. It needs a compiler to compile the file and generate it in JavaScript file, which can run directly on the browser. The TypeScript source file is in ".ts" extension. We can use any valid ".js" file by renaming it to ".ts" file. TypeScript uses TSC (TypeScript Compiler) compiler, which convert Typescript code (.ts file) to JavaScript (.js file).

<b>Why use TypeScript?</b>

We use TypeScript because of the following benefits.

1. TypeScript supports Static typing, Strongly type, Modules, Optional Parameters, etc.
2. TypeScript supports object-oriented programming features such as classes, interfaces, inheritance, generics, etc.
3. TypeScript is fast, simple, and most importantly, easy to learn.
4. TypeScript provides the error-checking feature at compilation time. It will compile the code, and if any error found, then it highlighted the mistakes before the script is run.
5. TypeScript supports all JavaScript libraries because it is the superset of JavaScript.
6. TypeScript support reusability because of the inheritance.
7. TypeScript make app development quick and easy as possible, and the tooling support of TypeScript gives us autocompletion, type checking, and source documentation.
8. TypeScript has a definition file with .d.ts extension to provide a definition for external JavaScript libraries.
9. TypeScript supports the latest JavaScript features, including ECMAScript 2015.
10. TypeScript gives all the benefits of ES6 plus more productivity.
Developers can save a lot of time with TypeScript.

# Nodejs

<b>What is Node.js</b>

Node.js is a cross-platform runtime environment and library for running JavaScript applications outside the browser. It is used for creating server-side and networking web applications. It is open source and free to use. It can be downloaded from this link https://nodejs.org/en/

Many of the basic modules of Node.js are written in JavaScript. Node.js is mostly used to run real-time server applications.

The definition given by its official documentation is as follows:

Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.?

Node.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules to simplify the development of web applications.

<code>Node.js = Runtime Environment + JavaScript Library  </code>

<b>Features of Node.js</b>

Following is a list of some important features of Node.js that makes it the first choice of software architects.

1. Extremely fast: Node.js is built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, so its library is very fast in code execution.
2. I/O is Asynchronous and Event Driven: All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous i.e. non-blocking. So a Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call. It is also a reason that it is very fast.
3. Single threaded: Node.js follows a single threaded model with event looping.
4. Highly Scalable: Node.js is highly scalable because event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way.
5. No buffering: Node.js cuts down the overall processing time while uploading audio and video files. Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.
6. Open source: Node.js has an open source community which has produced many excellent modules to add additional capabilities to Node.js applications.
7. License: Node.js is released under the MIT license.

# Expressjs

<b>What is Express.js</b>

Express is a fast, assertive, essential and moderate web framework of Node.js. You can assume express as a layer built on the top of the Node.js that helps manage a server and routes. It provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications.

<b>Let's see some of the core features of Express framework:</b>

1. It can be used to design single-page, multi-page and hybrid web applications.
2. It allows to setup middlewares to respond to HTTP Requests.
3. It defines a routing table which is used to perform different actions based on HTTP method and URL.
4. It allows to dynamically render HTML Pages based on passing arguments to templates.

<b>Why use Express</b>

1. Ultra fast I/O
2. Asynchronous and single threaded
3. MVC like structure
4. Robust API makes routing easy

# Angularjs

</b>What is AngularJS</b>
Angular JS is an open source JavaScript framework that is used to build web applications. It can be freely used, changed and shared by anyone.

Angular Js is developed by Google.

It is an excellent framework for building single phase applications and line of business applications.

<b>Advantage of AngularJS</b>

There are a lot of JavaScript frameworks for building web applications. So, it is a genuine question, why to use Angular JS.

Following are the advantages of AngularJS over other JavaScript frameworks:

1. Dependency Injection: Dependency Injection specifies a design pattern in which components are given their dependencies instead of hard coding them within the component.
2. Two way data binding: AngularJS creates a two way data-binding between the select element and the orderProp model. orderProp is then used as the input for the orderBy filter.
3. Testing: Angular JS is designed in a way that we can test right from the start. So, it is very easy to test any of its components through unit testing and end-to-end testing.
4. Model View Controller: In Angular JS, it is very easy to develop application in a clean MVC way. You just have to split your application code into MVC components i.e. Model, View and the Controller.
5. Directives, filters, modules, routes etc.

# Reactjs

<b>Why learn ReactJS?</b>

Today, many JavaScript frameworks are available in the market(like angular, node), but still, React came into the market and gained popularity amongst them. The previous frameworks follow the traditional data flow structure, which uses the DOM (Document Object Model). DOM is an object which is created by the browser each time a web page is loaded. It dynamically adds or removes the data at the back end and when any modifications were done, then each time a new DOM is created for the same page. This repeated creation of DOM makes unnecessary memory wastage and reduces the performance of the application.

Therefore, a new technology ReactJS framework invented which remove this drawback. ReactJS allows you to divide your entire application into various components. ReactJS still used the same traditional data flow, but it is not directly operating on the browser's Document Object Model (DOM) immediately; instead, it operates on a virtual DOM. It means rather than manipulating the document in a browser after changes to our data, it resolves changes on a DOM built and run entirely in memory. After the virtual DOM has been updated, React determines what changes made to the actual browser's DOM. The React Virtual DOM exists entirely in memory and is a representation of the web browser's DOM. Due to this, when we write a React component, we did not write directly to the DOM; instead, we are writing virtual components that react will turn into the DOM.

# Vuejs

Vue.js is an open-source progressive JavaScript framework used to develop interactive web user interfaces and single-page applications. Vue.js is mainly focused on the view part of the application that is also called front end development. Vue.js is going popular day by day because it is very easy to integrate with other projects and libraries. It is very simple to install and use. Even beginners can understand it easily and start building their own user interfaces.


<b>What is Vue.js?</b>
Vue.js is an open-source progressive JavaScript framework used to develop interactive web user interfaces and single-page applications (SPAs). Vue.js is commonly referred to as Vue and pronounced as "view.js" or "view."

<b>What is a Single Page Application (SPA)?</b>

A single page application or SPA is a web application or a website that provides users a very fluid, reactive, and fast experience similar to a desktop application. A single page application contains a menu, buttons, and blocks on a single page. When a user clicks on any of them, it dynamically rewrites the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server. That's the reason behind its reactive fast speed.

Vue is basically developed for frontend development, so it has to deal with a lot of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files. Vue.js facilitates users to extend HTML with HTML attributes called directives. Vue.js provides built-in directives and a lot of user-defined directives to enhance functionality to HTML applications.
